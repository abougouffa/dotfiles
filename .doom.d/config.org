* Intro :intro:
I started using *Emacs* about a year ago, in the beginning, I started my Vanilla
Emacs configuration which becomes very incontinent for a new Emacs user. I
discovered then Spacemacs, which made things much easier, and just after, I
found Doom Emacs, and since, I didn't quit my Emacs screen!

In the beginning, I was basically copying chunks of configs from the internet,
which quickly becomes a mess, specially because I was using a mixture of vanilla
Emacs style configs and Doom style ones.

Now I decided to rewrite a cleaner version of my config which will be more Doom
friendly, and for that, I found an inspiration in /[[https://github.com/tecosaur][tecosaur]]/'s [[https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-config.git][emacs-config]], so my
current config is heavily derived from /tecosaur/'s.

** This file
This is my literate configuration file, I use it to generate Doom's config files
(=$DOOMDIR/init.el=, =$DOOMDIR/packages.el= and =$DOOMDIR/config.el=), as well as some
other shell scripts, app launchers...

Make =config.el= run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports none :comments no :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/bin/bash
#+end_src

* General Settings :global:
** User information :user:info:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Abdelhak Bougouffa"
      user-mail-address "abougouffa@fedoraproject.org")
#+end_src

** Secrets :gpg:pass:secret:
Set the path to my GPG encrypted secrets. I like to set the cache expiry to =nil=,
+however, I still get a password prompt if I reopen =mu4e= after a while+.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil ; defaut is 2h (7200)
      password-cache-expiry nil)
#+end_src

** Better defaults :default:
*** File deletion :delete:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default delete-by-moving-to-trash t  ; Delete files to trash
              window-combination-resize t) ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
#+end_src

*** Undo and auto-save :save:undo:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq undo-limit 80000000   ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t   ; Nobody likes to lose work, I certainly don't
      scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)      ; It's nice to maintain a little margin
#+end_src

*** Mode-line :modeline:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This will set the time format to 24h
(setq display-time-string-forms
      '((propertize (concat 24-hours ":" minutes))))

(display-time-mode 1) ; Enable time in the mode-line

(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery)) ; On laptops...
  (display-battery-mode 1)) ; it's nice to know how much power you have
#+end_src

*** Editing :edit:cursor:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default x-stretch-cursor t)  ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative) ; Enable relative line numbers
(global-subword-mode 1)            ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src

*** Frame sizing :frame:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; start the initial frame maximized
(add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))

;; start every frame maximized
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
#+end_src

* Doom Configuration :doom:config:
** Modules (=init.el=) :module:
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

Here is the literate config which generates the Doom's =init.el= file, this file
contains all the enabled Doom modules with the appropriate flags.

#+name: init.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments no
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

*** Config (=:config=)
Enable =literate= configuration (like this file!), and some defaults.

;;(ivy +childframe           ; a search engine for love and life
;;     +fuzzy
;;     +icons
;;     +prescient)
#+end_src

*** User interface (=:ui=)
Enables some UI feautures for better user experience, Atom like =tabs=, the
beautiful =modeline=, project tree, better version control integration with
=vc-gutter=... and other useful stuff.
#+name: doom-ui
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Editor (=:editor=)
Some editing modules, the most important feauture is EVIL to enable Vim style
editing in Emacs. I like also to edit with multiple cursors, enable =yasnippet=
support, wrap long lines, auto format support (however, I don't enable =+onsave=
flag even if I like to, I'm experiencing an annoying behavior when I use it with
projects that defines =.editorconfig= rules, the formatter do not respect that,
nor the =clang-format= rules, I need to fix this).
#+name: doom-editor
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(evil +everywhere)           ; come to the dark side, we have cookies
file-templates               ; auto-snippets for empty files
fold                         ; (nigh) universal code folding
format                       ; automated prettiness
;;god                        ; run Emacs commands without modifier keys
;;lispy                      ; vim for lisp, for people who don't like vim
multiple-cursors             ; editing in many places at once
;;objed                      ; text object editing for the innocent
(parinfer +rust)             ; turn lisp into python, sort of
rotate-text                  ; cycle region at point between text candidates
snippets                     ; my elves. They type, so I don't have to
word-wrap                    ; soft wrapping with language-aware indent
#+end_src

*** Emacs' builtin (=:emacs=)
Beautify Emacs builtin packages.
#+name: doom-emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(dired +icons                ; making dired pretty [functional]
       +ranger)
electric                     ; smarter, keyword-based electric-indent
(ibuffer +icons)             ; interactive buffer management
(undo +tree)                 ; persistent, smarter undo for your inevitable mistakes
vc                           ; version-control and Emacs, sitting in a tree
#+end_src

*** Terminals (=:term=)
Run commands in terminal from Emacs. I use mainly =vterm=, I do enable =eshell= just
as a second choice.
#+name: doom-term
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
eshell                       ; the elisp shell that works everywhere
;;shell                      ; simple shell REPL for Emacs
;;term                       ; basic terminal emulator for Emacs
vterm                        ; the best terminal emulation in Emacs
#+end_src

*** Checkers (=:checkers=)
I like to check my documents for errors while I'm typing, however, sometimes it
makes Emacs runs slowly, specially on big files, so I will disable checking by
default, and I enable it when I need to.
#+name: doom-checkers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(syntax +childframe)   ; tasing you for every semicolon you forget
(spell +hunspell)      ; tasing you for misspelling mispelling
grammar                ; tasing grammar mistake every you make
#+end_src

*** Tools (=:tools=)
I enable some useful tools which facilitate my work flow, I like to enable
Docker support, [[https://editorconfig.org][EditorConfig]] is a good feature to have. I like to enable
=lsp-mode= and =dap-mode= for coding and debugging by enabling the =lsp= and =debugger=
modules with =+lsp= support.
I do enable some extra tools, like =magit=, =lookup=, =tmux=... etc.
#+name: doom-tools
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;ansible
(debugger +lsp)        ; FIXME stepping through code, to help you add bugs
;;direnv
docker
editorconfig           ; let someone else argue about tabs vs spaces

upload                 ; map local to remote projects via ssh/ftp
#+end_src

*** Operating system (=:os=)
I enable =tty= for better support of terminal editing, however, I use Vim (with
SpaceVim) in terminal editing, mainly because I'm facing problems every time I
try to use it, I need to investigate why!
#+name: doom-os
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tty +osc)             ; Configures Emacs for use in the terminal
;;(:if IS-MAC macos)   ; improve compatibility with macOS
#+end_src

*** Language support (=:lang=)
Most of the projects I'm working on are written in C/C++, Python and Rust, I use
Org-mode to manage all my papers and notes, so I need to enable as many
features as I need.
#+name: doom-lang
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Email (=:email=)
I like to use =mu4e= to manage mail mailboxes. The =+org= flag adds =org-msg= support and
=+gmail= for better management of Gmail accounts.
#+name: doom-email
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Apps (=:app=)
Emacs contains a ton of applications, some of them are supported by Doom, I like
to use Emacs manage my calendar, chat on IRC, and receive news. I do use EMMS
sometimes to play music without leaving Emacs, and I like to enable support for
=emacs-everywhere=.
#+name: doom-app
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
calendar
irc                    ; how neckbeards socialize

;;twitter              ; twitter client https://twitter.com/vnought
#+end_src

** User Interface :ui:
*** Font Face :font:
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
are the three important ones:

- =doom-font=
- =doom-unicode-font=
- =doom-variable-pitch-font=
- =doom-big-font= -- used for =doom-big-font-mode=; use this for presentations or streaming.

They all accept either a =font-spec=, font string (="Input Mono-12"=), or xlfd
font string. You generally only need these two:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "mononoki Nerd Font Mono" :size 32)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 36)
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :weight 'light))
#+end_src

*** Theme and Mode-line :theme:modeline:
Set Doom's theme:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-palenight) ; Load theme
#+end_src

**** COMMENT Mode-line encoding tweak
While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

** COMMENT Allow babel execution in =doom= CLI actions :babel:cli:
This file generates all my Doom config files, it works nicely, but for it to
work with =doom sync= et al. I need to make sure that Org doesn't try to confirm
that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.

While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around #'doom-shut-up-a)
#+end_src

** Asyncronous config tangling :async:babel:tangle:
Doom adds an =org-mode= hook ~+literate-enable-recompile-h~. This is a nice idea,
but it's too blocking for my taste. Since I trust my tangling to be fairly
straightforward, I'll just redefine it to a simpler, async, function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +literate-tangle-async-h ()
  "A very simplified version of `+literate-tangle-h', but async."
  :override #'+literate-tangle-h
  (let ((default-directory doom-private-dir))
    (async-shell-command
     (format "emacs --batch --eval \"(progn \
(require 'org) (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil) \
(org-babel-tangle-file \\\"%s\\\"))\""
             +literate-config-file))))
#+end_src

* Other Settings
** Editor Interaction :edit:
*** Mouse Buttons :mouse:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src

*** Splash Screen :splash:
**** Custom Splash Image :image:banner:
Change the logo to a fancy black hole, form [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/2204#issuecomment-626654221][this GitHub thread]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq fancy-splash-image (expand-file-name "assets/blackhole-lines-small.svg" doom-private-dir))
#+end_src

**** Clean Screen :clean:
Lastly, the doom dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful to me.
So, we'll disable them and then for a particularly /clean/ look disable
the modeline and ~hl-line-mode~, then also hide the cursor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook '+doom-dashboard-functions #'doom-dashboard-widget-shortmenu)
(add-hook! '+doom-dashboard-mode-hook (hide-mode-line-mode 1) (hl-line-mode -1))
(setq-hook! '+doom-dashboard-mode-hook evil-normal-state-cursor (list nil))
#+end_src

At the end, we have a minimal but rather nice splash screen.

**** The ASCII Banner :ascii:banner:
I haven't forgotten about the ASCII banner though! Once again we're going for
something simple.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-dashboard-draw-ascii-emacs-banner-fn ()
  (let* ((banner
          '(",---.,-.-.,---.,---.,---."
            "|---'| | |,---||    `---."
            "`---'` ' '`---^`---'`---'"))
         (longest-line (apply #'max (mapcar #'length banner))))
    (put-text-property
     (point)
     (dolist (line banner (point))
       (insert (+doom-dashboard--center
                +doom-dashboard--width
                (concat
                 line (make-string (max 0 (- longest-line (length line)))
                                   32)))
               "\n"))
     'face 'doom-dashboard-banner)))

(unless (display-graphic-p) ; for some reason this messes up the graphical splash screen atm
  (setq +doom-dashboard-ascii-banner-fn #'doom-dashboard-draw-ascii-emacs-banner-fn))
#+end_src

** Systemd Daemon :daemon:systemd:
For running a systemd service for an Emacs server I have the following
#+name: emacsclient service
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service :mkdirp yes
[Unit]
Description=Emacs server daemon
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=sh -c 'emacs --daemon && emacsclient -c --eval "(delete-frame)"'
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --no-wait --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook nil) (kill-emacs))"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

which is then enabled by
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled emacs.service")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
#+end_src

For some reason if a frame isn't opened early in the initialization process, the
daemon doesn't seem to like opening frames later --- hence the ~&& emacsclient~
part of the =ExecStart= value.

It can now be nice to use this as a 'default app' for opening files. If we add
an appropriate desktop entry, and enable it in the desktop environment.

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacs-client.desktop :mkdirp yes
[Desktop Entry]

GenericName=Text Editor

Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=TextEditor;Utility;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
Keywords=Text;Editor;
X-KDE-StartupNotify=false
#+end_src

When the daemon is running, I almost always want to do a few particular things
with it, so I may as well eat the load time at startup. We also want to keep
=mu4e= running.

It would be good to start the IRC client (=circe=) too, but that seems to have
issues when started in a non-graphical session.

Lastly, while I'm not sure quite why it happens, but after a bit it seems that
new Emacsclient frames start on the =*scratch*= buffer instead of the dashboard.
I prefer the dashboard, so let's ensure that's always switched to in new frames.

#+name: daemon initialization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun greedily-do-daemon-setup ()
  (require 'org)
  (when (require 'mu4e nil t)
    (setq mu4e-confirm-quit t)

      (mu4e~start)))
  (when (require 'elfeed nil t)
    (run-at-time nil (* 8 60 60) #'elfeed-update)))

(when (daemonp)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'greedily-do-daemon-setup)
  (add-hook! 'server-after-make-frame-hook (switch-to-buffer +doom-dashboard-name))
  (add-hook! 'server-after-make-frame-hook (doom/reload-theme)))
#+end_src

** Emacs Client Wrapper :client:
I frequently want to make use of Emacs while in a terminal emulator. To make
this easier, I can construct a few handy aliases.

However, a little convenience script in =~/.local/bin= can have the same effect,
be available beyond the specific shell I plop the alias in, then also allow me
to add a few bells and whistles --- namely:
+ Accepting stdin by putting it in a temporary file and immediately opening it.
+ Guessing that the =tty= is a good idea when ~$DISPLAY~ is unset (relevant with SSH
  sessions, among other things).
+ With a whiff of 24-bit color support, sets ~TERM~ variable to a =terminfo= that
  (probably) announces 24-bit color support.
+ Changes GUI =emacsclient= instances to be non-blocking by default (~--no-wait~),
  and instead take a flag to suppress this behaviour (~-w~).

I would use =sh=, but using arrays for argument manipulation is just too
convenient, so I'll raise the requirement to =bash=. Since arrays are the only
'extra' compared to =sh=, other shells like =ksh= etc. should work too.

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character

table

** Mixed pitch :mixed:pitch:
We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialization, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialization and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialization.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also, immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default. This was created
for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Droid Serif" :size 32))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."

** Theme magic :theme:magic:terminal:
Let's automatically update terminals on theme change (as long as ~pywal~ is available).

Unfortunately, as the theme is set on startup this causes the hook to be run
immediately. It would be nicer to /not/ have this add to our precious startup
time (around 0.4s last time I checked).
We can achieve this by deferring it with a short idle timer that should add the
hook /just after/ initialization.

** COMMENT IRC :irc:
=circe= is a client for IRC in Emacs (hey, isn't that a nice project
name+acronym), and a greek enchantress who turned humans into animals.

Let's use the former to chat to +recluses+ discerning individuals online.

Before we start seeing and sending messages, we need to authenticate with our
IRC servers. The circe manual provided a snippet for putting some auth
details in =.authinfo.gpg= --- but I think we should go further than that: have
the entire server info in our authinfo.

First, a reasonable format by which we can specify:
+ server
+ port
+ SASL username
+ SASL password
+ channels to join

We can have these stored like so
#+begin_src authinfo
machine chat.freenode.net login USERNAME password PASSWORD port PORT for irc channels emacs,org-mode
#+end_src

The ~for irc~ bit is used, so we can uniquely identify all IRC auth info. By
omitting the =#= in channel names we can have a list of channels comma-separated
(no space!) which the secrets API will return as a single string.

** COMMENT Newsfeed :rss:news:
RSS feeds are still a thing. Why not make use of them with =elfeed=.
I really like what [[https://github.com/fuxialexander/doom-emacs-private-xfu/tree/master/modules/app/rss][fuxialexander]] has going on, but I don't think I need a custom
module. Let's just try to patch on the main things I like the look of.

** COMMENT Mail :mail:
[[xkcd:1467]]

*** Fetching
The contenders for this seem to be:
+ [[https://www.offlineimap.org/][OfflineIMAP]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP][ArchWiki page]])
+ [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][isync/mbsync]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/isync][ArchWiki page]])

From perusing r/emacs the prevailing opinion seems to be that
+ isync is faster
+ isync works more reliably
So let's use that.

The config was straightforward, and is located at [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]].
I'm currently successfully connecting to: Gmail, office365mail, and dovecot.
I'm also shoving passwords in my [[file:~/.authinfo.gpg][authinfo.gpg]] and fetching them using ~PassCmd~:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no :eval no
gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk '/machine IMAP_SERCER login EMAIL_ADDR/ {print $NF}'
#+end_src

We can run ~mbsync -a~ in a systemd service file or something, but we can do
better than that. [[https://github.com/vsemyonoff/easymail#usage][vsemyonoff/easymail]] seems like the sort of thing we want, but
is written for =notmuch= unfortunately. We can still use it for inspiration though.
Using [[https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify][goimapnotify]] we should be able to sync just after new
mail. Unfortunately this means /yet another/ config file :(

We install with
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "goimapnotify") "no" "setup.sh")
go get -u gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify
ln -s ~/.local/share/go/bin/goimapnotify ~/.local/bin/
#+end_src

Here's the general plan:
1. Use ~goimapnotify~ to monitor mailboxes
   This needs it's own set of configs, and =systemd= services, which is a pain. We
   remove this pain by writing a python script (found below) to setup these
   config files, and systemd services by parsing the  [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]] file.
2. On new mail, call ~mbsync --pull --new ACCOUNT:BOX~
   We try to be as specific as possible, so ~mbsync~ returns as soon as possible,
   and we can /get those emails as soon as possible/.
3. Try to call ~mu index --lazy-fetch~.
   This fails if mu4e is already open (due to a write lock on the database), so
   in that case we just ~touch~ a tmp file (=/tmp/mu_reindex_now=).
4. Separately, we set up Emacs to check for the existance of
   =/tmp/mu_reindex_now= once a second while mu4e is
   running, and (after deleting the file) call ~mu4e-update-index~.

Let's start off by handling the elisp side of things

#+end_src

**** Config transcoding & service management
As long as the =mbsyncrc= file exists, this is as easy as running
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (file-exists-p "~/.config/imapnotify") "no" "setup.sh")
~/.config/doom/misc/mbsync-imapnotify.py
#+end_src

When run without flags this will perform the following actions
+ Read, and parse [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]], specifically recognising the following properties
  - ~IMAPAccount~
  - ~Host~
  - ~Port~
  - ~User~
  - ~Password~
  - ~PassCmd~
  - ~Patterns~
+ Call ~mbsync --list ACCOUNT~, and filter results according to ~Patterns~
+ Construct a imapnotify config for each account, with the following hooks
  - onNewMail :: src_shell{mbsync --pull ACCOUNT:MAILBOX}
  - onNewMailPost :: src_shell{if mu index --lazy-check; then test -f /tmp/mu_reindex_now && rm /tmp/mu_reindex_now; else touch /tmp/mu_reindex_now; fi}
+ Compare accounts list to previous accounts, enable/disable the relevant
  systemd services, called with the ~--now~ flag (start/stop services as well)

This script also supports the following flags
+ ~--status~ to get the status of the relevant systemd services supports =active=,
  =failing=, and =disabled=
+ ~--enable~ to enable all relevant systemd services
+ ~--disable~ to disable all relevant systemd services

**** Systemd
We then have a service file to run ~goimapnotify~ on all of these generated config files.
We'll use a template service file so we can enable a unit per-account.
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/goimapnotify@.service
[Unit]
Description=IMAP notifier using IDLE, golang version.
ConditionPathExists=%h/.config/imapnotify/%I/notify.conf
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/goimapnotify -conf %h/.config/imapnotify/%I/notify.conf
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

Enabling the service is actually taken care of by that python script.

From one or two small tests, this can bring the delay down to as low as five
seconds, which I'm quite happy with.

This works well for fetching new mail, but we also want to propagate other
changes (e.g. marking mail as read), and make sure we're up to date at the
start, so for that I'll do the 'normal' thing and run ~mbsync -all~ every so often
--- let's say five minutes.

We can accomplish this via a systemd timer, and service file.
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/mbsync.timer
[Unit]
Description=call mbsync on all accounts every 5 minutes
ConditionPathExists=%h/.mbsyncrc

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5m
OnUnitInactiveSec=5m

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/mbsync.service
[Unit]
Description=mbsync service, sync all mail
Documentation=man:mbsync(1)
ConditionPathExists=%h/.mbsyncrc

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mbsync -c %h/.mbsyncrc --all

[Install]
WantedBy=mail.target
#+end_src

Enabling (and starting) this is as simple as
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled mbsync.timer")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable mbsync.timer --now
#+end_src

*** Indexing/Searching
This is performed by [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][Mu]]. This is a tool for finding emails stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] format.
According to the homepage, it's main features are
+ Fast indexing
+ Good searching
+ Support for encrypted and signed messages
+ Rich CLI tooling
+ accent/case normalisation
+ strong integration with email clients

Unfortunately ~mu~ is not currently packaged from me. Oh well, I guess I'm
building it from source then. I needed to install these packages
+ =gmime-devel=
+ =xapian-core-devel=

#+name: Install mu from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "mu") "no" "setup.sh")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/djcb/mu.git
cd ./mu
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

To check how my version compares to the latest published:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/djcb/mu/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/'
mu --version | head -n 1 | sed 's/.* version //'
#+end_src

#+results:
| 1.4.6 |
| 1.4.6 |
*** Sending
[[https://www.nongnu.org/smtpmail/][SmtpMail]] seems to be the 'default' starting point, but that's not packaged for
me. [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] is however, so I'll give that a shot. Reading around a bit (googling
"msmtp vs sendmail" for example) almost every comparison mentioned seems to
suggest msmtp to be a better choice. I have seen the following points raised
+ ~sendmail~ has several vulnerabilities
+ ~sendmail~ is tedious to configure
+ ~ssmtp~ is no longer maintained
+ ~msmtp~ is a maintained alternative to ~ssmtp~
+ ~msmtp~ is easier to configure

The config file is [[file:~/.config/msmtp/config][~/.config/msmtp/config]].

**** System hackery
Unfortunately, I seem to have run into a [[https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44994][bug]] present in my packaged version, so
we'll just install the latest from source.

For full use of the ~auth~ options, I need =GNU SASL=, which isn't packaged for me.
I don't think I want it, but in case I do, I'll need to do this.
#+name: Install gsasl from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "msmtp") "no" "setup.sh")
export GSASL_VERSION=1.8.1
cd ~/.local/lib/
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/gsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
cd "./libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
cd "./gsasl-$VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
#+end_src

Now actually compile ~msmtp~.
#+name: Install msmtp from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "msmtp") "no" "setup.sh")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/marlam/msmtp-mirror.git ./msmtp
cd ./msmtp
libtoolize --force
aclocal
autoheader
automake --force-missing --add-missing
autoconf
# if using GSASL
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-libgsasl
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

If using =GSASL= (from earlier) we need to make ensure that the dynamic library in
in the library path. We can do by adding an executable with the same name
earlier on in my ~$PATH~.
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :shebang "#!/bin/sh"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib exec /usr/local/bin/msmtp "$@"
#+end_src

*** Mu4e
Webmail clients are nice and all, but I still don't believe that SPAs in my
browser can replaced desktop apps ... sorry Gmail. I'm also liking google less
and less.

Mailspring is a decent desktop client, quite lightweight for electron
(apparently the backend is in =C=, which probably helps), however I miss Emacs
stuff.

While =Notmuch= seems very promising, and I've heard good things about it, it
doesn't seem to make any changes to the emails themselves. All data is stored in
Notmuch's database. While this is a very interesting model, occasionally I need
to pull up an email on say my phone, and so not I want the tagging/folders etc.
to be applied to the mail itself --- not stored in a database.

On the other hand =Mu4e= is also talked about a lot in positive terms, and seems
to possess a similarly strong feature set --- and modifies the mail itself (I.e.
information is accessible without the database). =Mu4e= also seems to have a large
user base, which tends to correlate with better support and attention.

As I installed mu4e from source, I need to add the =/usr/local/= loadpath so Mu4e has a chance of loading
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (file-directory-p "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e") "yes" "no")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
#+end_src

**** Viewing Mail
There seem to be some advantages with using Gnus' article view (such as inline
images), and judging from [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/pull/1442#issuecomment-591695814][djcb/mu!1442 (comment)]] this seems to be the 'way of
the future' for mu4e.

There are some all-the-icons font related issues, so we need to redefine the
fancy chars, and make sure they get the correct width.

To account for the increase width of each flag character, and make perform a
few more visual tweaks, we'll tweak the headers a bit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq mu4e-headers-fields
        '((:flags . 6)
          (:account-stripe . 2)
          (:from-or-to . 25)
          (:folder . 10)
          (:recipnum . 2)
          (:subject . 80)
          (:human-date . 8))
        +mu4e-min-header-frame-width 142
        mu4e-headers-date-format "%d/%m/%y"
        mu4e-headers-time-format "⧖ %H:%M"
        mu4e-headers-results-limit 1000
        mu4e-index-cleanup t)

  (add-to-list 'mu4e-bookmarks
               '(:name "Yesterday's messages" :query "date:2d..1d" :key ?y) t)

  (defvar +mu4e-header--folder-colors nil)
  (appendq! mu4e-header-info-custom
            '((:folder .
               (:name "Folder" :shortname "Folder" :help "Lowest level folder" :function
                (lambda (msg)
                  (+mu4e-colorize-str
                   (replace-regexp-in-string "\\`.*/" "" (mu4e-message-field msg :maildir))
                   '+mu4e-header--folder-colors)))))))
#+end_src

We'll also use a nicer alert icon
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mu4e-alert-icon "/usr/share/icons/Papirus/64x64/apps/evolution.svg")
#+end_src
**** Sending Mail
Let's send emails too.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq sendmail-program "/usr/bin/msmtp"
        send-mail-function #'smtpmail-send-it
        message-sendmail-f-is-evil t
        message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from"); , "--read-recipients")
        message-send-mail-function #'message-send-mail-with-sendmail))
#+end_src

It's also nice to avoid accidentally sending emails with the wrong account. If
we can send from the address in the ~To~ field, let's do that. Opening a prompt
otherwise also seems sensible.

We can register Emacs as a potential email client with the following desktop
file, thanks to Etienne Deparis's [[https://etienne.depar.is/emacs.d/mu4e.html][Mu4e customization]].
#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacsmail.desktop :mkdirp yes
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Compose message in Emacs
GenericName=Compose a new message with Mu4e in Emacs
Comment=Open mu4e compose window
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;
Exec=emacsclient -create-frame --alternate-editor="" --no-wait --eval '(progn (x-focus-frame nil) (mu4e-compose-from-mailto "%u"))'
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Network;Email;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
#+end_src

To register this, just call
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/mailto") "emacsmail.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
#+end_src

We also want to define ~mu4e-compose-from-mailto~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun mu4e-compose-from-mailto (mailto-string)
  (require 'mu4e)
  (unless mu4e~server-props (mu4e t) (sleep-for 0.1))
  (let* ((mailto (rfc2368-parse-mailto-url mailto-string))
         (to (cdr (assoc "To" mailto)))
         (subject (or (cdr (assoc "Subject" mailto)) ""))
         (body (cdr (assoc "Body" mailto)))
         (org-msg-greeting-fmt (if (assoc "Body" mailto)
                                   (replace-regexp-in-string "%" "%%"
                                                             (cdr (assoc "Body" mailto)))
                                 org-msg-greeting-fmt))
         (headers (-filter (lambda (spec) (not (-contains-p '("To" "Subject" "Body") (car spec)))) mailto)))
    (mu4e~compose-mail to subject headers)))
#+end_src
This may not quite function as intended for now due to [[github:jeremy-compostella/org-msg/issues/52][jeremy-compostella/org-msg#52]].

It would also be nice to change the name pre-filled in =From:= when drafting.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mu4e-from-name "Timothy"
  "Name used in \"From:\" template.")
(defadvice! mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed (orig-fn)
  "Wrap `mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed' to change the name."
  :around #'mu4e~draft-from-construct
  (let ((user-full-name mu4e-from-name))
    (funcall orig-fn)))
#+end_src

We can also use this a signature,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq message-signature mu4e-from-name)
#+end_src
*** Org Msg
Doom does a fantastic stuff with the defaults with this, so we only make a few
minor tweaks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +org-msg-accent-color "#1a5fb4"
      org-msg-greeting-fmt "\nHi %s,\n\n"
      org-msg-signature "\n\n#+begin_signature\nAll the best,\\\\\n*Timothy*\n#+end_signature")
(map! :map org-msg-edit-mode-map
      :after org-msg
      :n "G" #'org-msg-goto-body)
#+end_src

** Plaintext
It's nice to see ANSI colour codes displayed. However, until Emacs 28 it's not
possible to do this without modifying the buffer, so let's condition this block
on that.

(after! text-mode
  (add-hook! 'text-mode-hook

*** Intro
Beyond the elegance in the markup language, tremendously rich integrations with
Emacs allow for some fantastic [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][features]], such as what seems to be the best
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] of any currently available technology.

#+name: Literate programming workflow

An =.org= file can contain blocks of code (with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb][noweb]] templating support), which
can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] to dedicated source code files, and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][woven]] into a document
(report, documentation, presentation, etc.) through various (/extensible/) methods.
These source blocks may even create images or other content to be included in
the document, or generate source code.

Finally, because this section is fairly expensive to initialise, we'll wrap it
in an src_elisp{(after! ...)} block.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :tangle yes :noweb-ref nil
(after! org
  <<org-conf>>
)
#+end_src

*** System config
**** Mime types
Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.

#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">
    <comment>Emacs Org-mode File</comment>
    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
#+end_src

What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src

Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org
#+end_src

**** Git diffs
Based on this [[https://gist.github.com/ruediger/5647207][gist]].

Protesilaos wrote a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-26-git-diff-hunk-elisp-org/][very helpful article]] in which he explains how to change the
git diff chunk heading to something more useful than just the immediate line
above the hunk --- like the parent heading.

This can be achieved by first adding a new diff mode to git in =~/.config/git/attributes=
#+begin_src fundamental :tangle ~/.config/git/attributes :mkdirp yes
,*.tex   diff=tex
,*.bib   diff=bibtex
,*.c     diff=cpp
,*.h     diff=cpp
,*.c++   diff=cpp
,*.h++   diff=cpp
,*.cpp   diff=cpp
,*.hpp   diff=cpp
,*.cc    diff=cpp
,*.hh    diff=cpp
,*.m     diff=matlab
,*.py    diff=python
,*.rb    diff=ruby
,*.php   diff=php
,*.pl    diff=perl
,*.html  diff=html
,*.xhtml diff=html
,*.f     diff=fortran
,*.lisp  diff=lisp
,*.el    diff=lisp
,*.r     diff=rstats
,*.texi* diff=texinfo
,*.org   diff=org
,*.rs    diff=rust

,*.pdf   diff=pdf
,*.png   diff=exif
,*.jpg   diff=exif
,*.jpeg  diff=exif
,*.gif   diff=exif
#+end_src

Then adding a regex for it to =~/.config/git/config=
#+begin_src gitconfig :tangle ~/.config/git/config :mkdirp yes
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\(.*)$"
#      xfuncname = "^(\\((cl-)?def(un|macro|method).*)$"
[diff "rstats"]
  xfuncname = "^([a-zA-z.]+ <- function.*)$"
[diff "texinfo"]
# from http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=blob;f=.gitattributes;h=c3b2926c78c939d94358cc63d051a70d38cfea5d;hb=HEAD
  xfuncname = "^@node[ \t][ \t]*\\([^,][^,]*\\)"
[diff "orgmode"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+.*)$"
[diff "rust"] # Thanks to csabahenk
  xfuncname = "^[ \t]*(pub|)[ \t]*((fn|struct|enum|impl|trait|mod)[^;]*)$"
[diff "exif"]
  binary = true
# sudo apt-get install perl-image-exiftool
  textconv = exiftool
[diff "pdf"]
  textconv = pdftotext-stdout
# sudo apt-get install pdftotext
#+end_src

Add a custom script to output =pdftotext='s output to stdout:
#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/.local/bin/pdftotext-stdout :mkdirp yes :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/bin/bash
pdftotext "$@" -
#+end_src

*** Behaviour
**** Tweaking defaults
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/Dropbox/Org/"              ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convenient
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})       ; don't treat lone _ / ^ as sub/superscripts, require _{} / ^{}
#+end_src

I also like the src_elisp{:comments} header-argument, so let's make that a
default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

There also seem to be a few keybindings which use =hjkl=, but miss arrow key equivalents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-org-mode-map
      :after evil-org
      :n "g <up>" #'org-backward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <down>" #'org-forward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <left>" #'org-up-element
      :n "g <right>" #'org-down-element)
#+end_src

**** Extra functionality
***** COMMENT Org buffer creation
Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb-ref none
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src

***** COMMENT The utility of zero-width spaces
Occasionally in Org you run into annoyances where you want to have two seperate
blocks right together without a space. For example, to *emp​h*​asise part of a word,
or put a currency symbol immediately before an inline source block.
There is a solution to this, it just sounds slightly hacky --- zero width spaces.
Because this is Emacs, we can make this feel much less hacky by making a minor
addition to the Org key map 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :nie "M-SPC M-SPC" (cmd! (insert "\u200B")))
#+end_src

We then want to stop the space from being included in exports, which can be done
with a little filter.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-remove-zero-width-space (text _backend _info)
  "Remove zero width spaces from TEXT."
  (unless (org-export-derived-backend-p 'org)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "\u200B" "" text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-export-remove-zero-width-space t)
#+end_src

***** COMMENT List bullet sequence
I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src

***** Citation (=org-ref=)
Occasionally I want to cite something, and =org-ref= is /the/ package for that.

Unfortunately, it ignores the ~file = {...}~ =.bib= keys though. Let's fix that.
I separate files on =;=, which may just be a Zotero/BetterBibLaTeX thing, but it's
a good idea in my case at least.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-ref
  :after org
  :config
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf-a ()
    :override #'org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf
    (save-excursion
      (bibtex-beginning-of-entry)
      (let* ((bibtex-expand-strings t)
             (entry (bibtex-parse-entry t))
             (key (reftex-get-bib-field "=key=" entry))
             (pdf (or
                   (car (-filter (lambda (f) (string-match-p "\\.pdf$" f))
                                 (split-string (reftex-get-bib-field "file" entry) ";")))
                   (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key))))
        (if (file-exists-p pdf)
            (org-open-file pdf)
          (ding)))))
  (defadvice! org-ref-open-pdf-at-point-a ()
    "Open the pdf for bibtex key under point if it exists."
    :override #'org-ref-open-pdf-at-point
    (interactive)
    (let* ((results (org-ref-get-bibtex-key-and-file))
           (key (car results))
           (pdf-file (funcall org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function key)))
      (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect (cdr results))
        (save-excursion
          (bibtex-search-entry (car results))
          (org-ref-open-bibtex-pdf))))))
#+end_src

***** Spellcheck
I turn off spell checking by default to make Org files open quickly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

   that there are entries following with keys like \"ab\", \"ax\"…

2. Select-able members must have more than two elements, with the first
   being the string of keys that lead to selecting it, and the second a
   short description string of the item.

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)
under this key will be shown and offered for selection.

TITLE will be placed over the selection in the temporary buffer,

That said, if the directory doesn't exist we likely don't want to be using roam.
Since we don't want to trigger errors (which will happen as soon as roam tries
to initialise), let's not load roam.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle (if (file-exists-p "~/Dropbox/Org/slip-box") "no" "packages.el")

***** COMMENT Registering roam protocol

**** Snippet Helpers
I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-header-p ()
  "Determine whether `point' is within a src-block header or header-args."
  (pcase (org-element-type (org-element-context))
    ('src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the src-block
                   (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                   (forward-line 1)
                                   (point))))
    ('inline-src-block (< (point) ; before code part of the inline-src-block
                          (save-excursion (goto-char (org-element-property :begin (org-element-context)))
                                          (search-forward "]{")
                                          (point))))
    ('keyword (string-match-p "^header-args" (org-element-property :value (org-element-context))))))
#+end_src

Now let's write a function we can reference in yasnippets to produce a nice
interactive way to specify header args.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-prompt-header-arg (arg question values)
  "Prompt the user to set ARG header property to one of VALUES with QUESTION.
The default value is identified and indicated. If either default is selected,
or no selection is made: nil is returned."
  (let* ((src-block-p (not (looking-back "^#\\+property:[ \t]+header-args:.*" (line-beginning-position))))
         (default
           (or
            (cdr (assoc arg
                        (if src-block-p
                            (nth 2 (org-babel-get-src-block-info t))
                          (org-babel-merge-params
                           org-babel-default-header-args
                           (let ((lang-headers
                                  (intern (concat "org-babel-default-header-args:"
                                                  (+yas/org-src-lang)))))
                             (when (boundp lang-headers) (eval lang-headers t)))))))
            ""))
         default-value)
    (setq values (mapcar
                  (lambda (value)
                    (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote value) default)
                        (setq default-value
                              (concat value " "
                                      (propertize "(default)" 'face 'font-lock-doc-face)))
                      value))
                  values))
    (let ((selection (consult--read question values :default default-value)))
      (unless (or (string-match-p "(default)$" selection)
                  (string= "" selection))
        selection))))
#+end_src

Finally, we fetch the language information for new source blocks.

Since we're getting this info, we might as well go a step further and also
provide the ability to determine the most popular language in the buffer that
doesn't have any =header-args= set for it (with =#+properties=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +yas/org-src-lang ()
  "Try to find the current language of the src/header at `point'.
Return nil otherwise."
  (let ((context (org-element-context)))
    (pcase (org-element-type context)
      ('src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('inline-src-block (org-element-property :language context))
      ('keyword (when (string-match "^header-args:\\([^ ]+\\)" (org-element-property :value context))
                  (match-string 1 (org-element-property :value context)))))))

(defun +yas/org-last-src-lang ()
  "Return the language of the last src-block, if it exists."
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (when (re-search-backward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
      (org-element-property :language (org-element-context)))))

(defun +yas/org-most-common-no-property-lang ()
  "Find the lang with the most source blocks that has no global header-args, else nil."
  (let (src-langs header-langs)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) src-langs))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+property: +header-args" nil t)
        (push (+yas/org-src-lang) header-langs)))

    (setq src-langs
          (mapcar #'car
                  ;; sort alist by frequency (desc.)
                  (sort
                   ;; generate alist with form (value . frequency)
                   (cl-loop for (n . m) in (seq-group-by #'identity src-langs)
                            collect (cons n (length m)))
                   (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b))))))

    (car (cl-set-difference src-langs header-langs :test #'string=))))
#+end_src

**** Translate capital keywords (old) to lower case (new)
Everyone used to use ~#+CAPITAL~ keywords. Then people realised that ~#+lowercase~
is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.
#+begin_quote
Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]
#+end_quote

To avoid sometimes having to choose between the hassle out of updating old
documents and using mixed syntax, I'll whip up a basic transcode-y function.
It likely misses some edge cases, but should mostly work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-syntax-convert-keyword-case-to-lower ()
  "Convert all #+KEYWORDS to #+keywords."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((count 0)
          (case-fold-search nil))
      (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+[A-Z_]+" nil t)
        (unless (s-matches-p "RESULTS" (match-string 0))
          (replace-match (downcase (match-string 0)) t)
          (setq count (1+ count))))
      (message "Replaced %d occurances" count))))
#+end_src

**** Fix problematic hooks
When one of the src_elisp{org-mode-hook} functions errors, it halts the hook
execution. This is problematic, and there are two hooks in particular which
cause issues. Let's make their failure less eventful.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! shut-up-org-problematic-hooks (orig-fn &rest args)
  :around #'org-fancy-priorities-mode
  :around #'org-superstar-mode
  (ignore-errors (apply orig-fn args)))
#+end_src

*** Visuals
Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

**** Font Display
Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

While ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ is very nice, it can sometimes make edits which
occur at the border a bit more fiddley. We can improve this situation without
sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)
  ;; for proper first-time setup, `org-appear--set-elements'
  ;; needs to be run after other hooks have acted.
  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-elements))
#+end_src

**** COMMENT Font trick
Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src

Apparently this causes issues with some people, but I haven't noticed anything
problematic beyond the expected slight delay in some fontification, so until I
do I'll use the above.

**** Fontifying inline src blocks
Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.

**** Symbols
It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.
I've also added some fun alternatives, just commented out.

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier highlighting
First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** More eager rendering
What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering
It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).
Let's start by adding a sans font. I'd also like to use some of the
functionality from =bmc-maths=, so we'll load that too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-2.54cm}
\\setlength{\\evensidemargin}{\\oddsidemargin}
\\setlength{\\textheight}{\\paperheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headsep}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\footskip}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\topmargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-2.54cm}
% my custom stuff
\\usepackage[nofont,plaindd]{bmc-maths}
\\usepackage{arev}
")
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-options
      (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent"))
#+end_src

***** Rendering speed tests
We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135 \pm 2 ms | 215 \pm 3 ms    |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89 \pm 2 ms   | 178 \pm 2 ms   | 12 \pm 2 ms    |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226 \pm 2 ms | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392 \pm 4 ms | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230 \pm 2 ms | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[LaTeX Rendering]].

#+begin_warning
Unfortunately, it seems that SVG sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now.

*** Exporting
**** General settings
By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
#+end_src

Since I (roughly) track Org ~HEAD~, it makes sense to include the git version in
the creator string.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-creator-string
      (format "Emacs %s (Org mode %s %s)" emacs-version (org-release) (org-git-version)))
#+end_src

**** COMMENT Acronym formatting
I like automatically using spaced small caps for acronyms. For strings I want to
be unaffected let's use ~;~ as a prefix to prevent the transformation --- i.e.
~;JFK~ (as one would want for two-letter geographic locations and names).

This has to be implemented on a per-format basis, currently HTML and LaTeX
exports are supported.

**** LaTeX Export
***** Compiling
By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

***** COMMENT A cleverer preamble
****** Use case
We often want particular snippets of LaTeX in our documents preambles.
It's a pain to have to work out / remember them every time.
For example, I almost always want to include the snippet below.

#+name: org-latex-embed-files-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
\\IfFileExists{./\\jobname.org}{\\embedfile[desc=The original file]{\\jobname.org}}{}
#+end_src

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead we can provide some granularity by splitting up the features we want,
and then take the experience to a whole new level by implementing a system to
automatically detect which features are desired and generating a preamble that
provides these features.

****** Conditional Content
Let's consider content we want in particular situations.

Captions could do with a bit of tweaking such that
+ You can easily have multiple captions
+ Links to figures take you to the /top/ of the figure (not the bottom)
+ Caption labels could do with being emphasised slightly more
+ Multiline captions should run ragged-right, but only when then span more than
  one line

#+name: org-latex-caption-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{subcaption}
\\usepackage[hypcap=true]{caption}
\\setkomafont{caption}{\\sffamily\\small}
\\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\\upshape\\bfseries}
\\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck=true}
\\usepackage{capt-of} % required by Org
#+end_src

The default checkboxes look rather ugly, so let's provide some prettier alternatives.

#+name: org-latex-checkbox-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\newcommand{\\checkboxUnchecked}{$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxTransitive}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{-0.1ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\Large\\textbf -}}$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxChecked}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{0.2ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\scriptsize \\ding{52}}}$\\square$}
#+end_src

It's nice to have "message blocks", things like info/warning/error/success.
A LaTeX macro should make them trivial to create.

#+name: org-latex-box-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
% args = #1 Name, #2 Colour, #3 Ding, #4 Label
\\newcommand{\\defsimplebox}[4]{%
  \\definecolor{#1}{HTML}{#2}
  \\newenvironment{#1}[1][]
  {%
    \\par\\vspace{-0.7\\baselineskip}%
    \\textcolor{#1}{#3} \\textcolor{#1}{\\textbf{\\def\\temp{##1}\\ifx\\temp\\empty#4\\else##1\\fi}}%
    \\vspace{-0.8\\baselineskip}
    \\begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}
  }{%
    \\end{addmargin}
    \\vspace{-0.5\\baselineskip}
  }%
}
#+end_src

Lastly, we will pass this content into some global variables we for ease of
access.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-embed-files-preamble "
<<org-latex-embed-files-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that embeds files within the pdf.")

(defvar org-latex-caption-preamble "
<<org-latex-caption-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves captions.")

(defvar org-latex-checkbox-preamble "
<<org-latex-checkbox-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves checkboxes.")

(defvar org-latex-box-preamble "
<<org-latex-box-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that provides a macro for custom boxes.")
#+end_src

In the "universal preamble", we already embed the source =.org= file, but it would
be nice to embed all the tangled files. This is fairly easy to accomplish by
mapping each tangled file to a form which embeds the file if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-embed-tangled-files ()
  "Return a string that uses embedfile to embed all tangled files."
  (mapconcat
   (lambda (tangle-file)
     (format "\\IfFileExists{%1$s}{\\embedfile[desc=Tangled %2$s file]{%1$s}}{}"
             (->> (car tangle-file)
               (replace-regexp-in-string "\\\\" "\\\\\\\\")
               (replace-regexp-in-string "~" "\\\\string~"))
             (cdr tangle-file)))
   (mapcar (lambda (f-block) (cons (or (car f-block) (caddr (cadr f-block))) (caadr f-block)))
           (org-babel-tangle-collect-blocks)) ; all files being tangled to
   "\n"))
#+end_src

****** Content-feature-preamble association
Initially this idea was implemented with an alist that associated a construct
that would search the current Org file for an indication that some feature was
needed, with a LaTeX snippet to be inserted in the preamble which would provide
that feature.
This is all well and good when there is a bijection between detected features
and the LaTeX code needed to support those features, but in many cases this
relation is not injective.

To better model the reality of the situation, I add an extra layer to this
process where each detected feature gives a list of required "feature flags".
Simply be merging the lists of feature flags we no longer have to require
injectivity to avoid LaTeX duplication. Then the extra layer forms a bijection
between there feature flags and a specification which can be used to implement
the feature.

This model also provides a number of nice secondary benefits, such as a simple
implementation of feature dependency.

The car can also be a

- function, which is called with info as an argument
- list, which is `eval'uated

If the symbol, function, or list produces a string: that is used as a regex
search in the buffer. Otherwise any non-nil return value will indicate the
existance of the feature.")
#+end_src

Then we provide a way to generate the preamble that provides those features.
In addition to the features named in ~org-latex-conditional-features~ we'll also
create /meta-features/, which can be required by other features (with =:requires=),
or be active by default (=:eager t=). For further control I some features may only
be used when certain other features are active (with =:when=), and masked by other
features (with =:prevents=). I will use the convention of starting meta-features
with =.=, and =:eager= features with =!= to make their nature more readily apparent.

Another consideration in LaTeX is load order, which matters in some cases.
Beyond that, it's nice to have some sort of sensible ordering. For this I'll
introduce an =:order= keyword. Using this I'll arrange snippets as follows.

+ =-2= Embed files setup
+ =-1= Extra file embedding
+ =0= Typography
  - =0= Fonts themselves
  - =0.1= Typographic tweaks (=microtype=)
  - =0.2= Maths setup
  - =0.3= Maths font
  - =0.4= Extra text shaping (~\acr~)
  - =0.5-0.9= Miscellaneous text modifications, trying to put shorter snippets first
+ =1= (/default/)

****** Feature determination
Now that we have ~org-latex-conditional-features~ defined, we need to use it to
extract a list of features found in an Org buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-detect-features (&optional buffer info)

#+end_src

****** Preamble generation
Once a list of required features has been determined, we want to use
~org-latex-feature-implementations~ to generate the LaTeX which should be inserted
into the preamble to provide those features.

First we want to process our fancy keywords in ~org-latex-feature-implementations~
to produce an /expanded/ list of features. We'll do that by performing the
following steps.
+ The dependencies for each listed feature are added to feature list
  (src_elisp{:requires}).
+ The src_elisp{:when} conditions of each feature, and available features with
  src_elisp{:eager t}, are evaluated, and added/removed accordingly
+ Any features present in a src_elisp{:prevents} value are removed
+ The feature list is scrubbed of duplicates
+ The feature list is sorted by src_elisp{:order} (ascending)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-expand-features (features)
  "For each feature in FEATURES process :requires, :when, and :prevents keywords and sort according to :order."
  (dolist (feature features)
    (unless (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)
      (error "Feature %s not provided in org-latex-feature-implementations" feature)))
  (setq current features)
  (while current
    (when-let ((requirements (plist-get (cdr (assq (car current) org-latex-feature-implementations)) :requires)))
      (setcdr current (if (listp requirements)
                          (append requirements (cdr current))
                        (cons requirements (cdr current)))))
    (setq current (cdr current)))
  (dolist (potential-feature
           (append features (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (feat)
                                                (when (plist-get (cdr feat) :eager)
                                                  (car feat)))
                                              org-latex-feature-implementations))))
    (when-let ((prerequisites (plist-get (cdr (assoc potential-feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :when)))
      (setf features (if (if (listp prerequisites)
                             (cl-every (lambda (preq) (memq preq features)) prerequisites)
                           (memq prerequisites features))
                         (append (list potential-feature) features)
                       (delq potential-feature features)))))
  (dolist (feature features)
    (when-let ((prevents (plist-get (cdr (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :prevents)))
      (setf features (cl-set-difference features (if (listp prevents) prevents (list prevents))))))
  (sort (delete-dups features)
        (lambda (feat1 feat2)
          (if (< (or (plist-get (cdr (assoc feat1 org-latex-feature-implementations)) :order) 1)
                 (or (plist-get (cdr (assoc feat2 org-latex-feature-implementations)) :order) 1))
              t nil))))
#+end_src

Now that we have a nice list of the final features to use, we can just pull out
their snippets and join the result together.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-generate-features-preamble (features)
  "Generate the LaTeX preamble content required to provide FEATURES.
This is done according to `org-latex-feature-implementations'"
  (let ((expanded-features (org-latex-expand-features features)))
    (concat
     (format "\n%% features: %s\n" expanded-features)
     (mapconcat (lambda (feature)
                  (when-let ((snippet (plist-get (cdr (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :snippet)))
                    (concat
                     (pcase snippet
                       ((pred stringp) snippet)
                       ((pred functionp) (funcall snippet features))
                       ((pred listp) (eval `(let ((features ',features)) (,@snippet))))
                       ((pred symbolp) (symbol-value snippet))
                       (_ (user-error "org-latex-feature-implementations :snippet value %s unable to be used" snippet)))
                     "\n")))
                expanded-features
                "")
     "% end features\n")))
#+end_src

Then Org needs to be advised to actually use this generated preamble content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar info--tmp nil)

(defadvice! org-latex-save-info (info &optional t_ s_)
  :before #'org-latex-make-preamble
  (setq info--tmp info))

(defadvice! org-splice-latex-header-and-generated-preamble-a (orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p &optional extra)
  "Dynamically insert preamble content based on `org-latex-conditional-preambles'."
  :around #'org-splice-latex-header
  (let ((header (funcall orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p extra)))
    (if snippets-p header
      (concat header
              (org-latex-generate-features-preamble (org-latex-detect-features nil info--tmp))
              "\n"))))
#+end_src

My use of ~info--tmp~ is somewhat hacky. When I try to upstream this, this should
become much cleaner as I can pass info through by directly modifying
~org-latex-make-preamble~.

***** COMMENT Reduce default packages
Thanks to our additions, we can remove a few packages from
~org-latex-default-packages-alist~.

There are also some obsolete entries in the default value, specifically
+ =grffile='s capabilities are built into the current version of =graphicx=
+ =textcomp='s functionality has been included in LaTeX's core for a while now

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-default-packages-alist
      '(("AUTO" "inputenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("T1" "fontenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("" "xcolor" nil) ; Generally useful
        ("" "hyperref" nil)))
#+end_src

****** Font collections
Using the lovely conditional preamble, I'll define a number of font collections
that can be used for LaTeX exports. Who knows, maybe I'll use it with other
export formats too at some point.

To start with I'll create a default state variable and register =fontset= as part
of =#+options=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'alegreya
  "Fontset from `org-latex-fontsets' to use by default.
As cm (computer modern) is TeX's default, that causes nothing
to be added to the document.

If \"nil\" no custom fonts will ever be used.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" org-latex-default-fontset)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))
#+end_src

Then a function is needed to generate a LaTeX snippet which applies the fontset. It
would be nice if this could be done for individual styles and use different
styles as the main document font. If the individual typefaces for a fontset are
defined individually as
src_elisp{:serif}, src_elisp{:sans}, src_elisp{:mono}, and src_elisp{:maths}.
I can use those to generate LaTeX for subsets of the full fontset. Then, if I
don't let any fontset names have =-= in them, I can use =-sans= and =-mono= as
suffixes that specify the document font to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-fontset-entry ()
  "Get the fontset spec of the current file.
Has format \"name\" or \"name-style\" where 'name' is one of
the cars in `org-latex-fontsets'."
  (let ((fontset-spec
         (symbol-name
          (or (car (delq nil
                         (mapcar
                          (lambda (opt-line)
                            (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex)
                                       :latex-font-set))
                          (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
              org-latex-default-fontset))))
    (cons (intern (car (split-string fontset-spec "-")))
          (when (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))
            (intern (concat ":" (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))))))))

(defun org-latex-fontset (&rest desired-styles)
  "Generate a LaTeX preamble snippet which applies the current fontset for DESIRED-STYLES."
  (let* ((fontset-spec (org-latex-fontset-entry))
         (fontset (alist-get (car fontset-spec) org-latex-fontsets)))
    (if fontset
        (concat
         (mapconcat
          (lambda (style)
            (when (plist-get fontset style)
              (concat (plist-get fontset style) "\n")))
          desired-styles
          "")
         (when (memq (cdr fontset-spec) desired-styles)
           (pcase (cdr fontset-spec)
             (:serif "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\rmdefault}\n")
             (:sans "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\sfdefault}\n")
             (:mono "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\ttdefault}\n"))))
      (error "Font-set %s is not provided in org-latex-fontsets" (car fontset-spec)))))
#+end_src

Now that all the functionality has been implemented, we should hook it into our
preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '(org-latex-default-fontset . custom-font) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(custom-font :snippet (org-latex-fontset :serif :sans :mono) :order 0) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.custom-maths-font :eager t :when (custom-font maths) :snippet (org-latex-fontset :maths) :order 0.3) t)
#+end_src

Finally, we just need to add some fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-fontsets
  '((cm nil) ; computer modern
    (## nil) ; no font set
    (alegreya

#+end_src

When we're using Alegreya we can apply a lovely little tweak to =tabular= which
(locally) changes the figures used to lining fixed-width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((string= (car (org-latex-fontset-entry)) "alegreya") . alegreya-typeface))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(alegreya-typeface) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations'(.alegreya-tabular-figures :eager t :when (alegreya-typeface table) :order 0.5 :snippet "

\\makeatother\n") t)
#+end_src

Due to the Alegreya's metrics, the =\LaTeX= symbol doesn't quite look right. We
can correct for this by redefining it with subtlety shifted kerning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '("LaTeX" . latex-symbol))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(latex-symbol :when alegreya-typeface :order 0.5 :snippet "

***** COMMENT Cover page
To make a nice cover page, a simple method that comes to mind is just redefining
=\maketitle=. To get precise control over the positioning we'll use the =tikz=
package, and then add in the Tikz libraries =calc= and =shapes.geometric= to make
some nice decorations for the background.

I'll start off by setting up the required additions to the preamble.
This will accomplish the following:
+ Load the required packages
+ Redefine =\maketitle=
+ Draw an Org icon with Tikz to use in the cover page (it's a little easter egg)
+ Start a new page after the table of contents by redefining =\tableofcontents=

Now we've got a nice cover page to work with, we just need to use it every now
and then. Adding this to =#+options= feels most appropriate.
Let's have the =coverpage= option accept =auto= as a value and then decide whether
or not a cover page should be used based on the word count --- I'll have this be
the global default. Then we just want to insert a LaTeX snippet tweak the
subtitle format to use the cover page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-cover-page 'auto
  "When t, use a cover page by default.
When auto, use a cover page when the document's wordcount exceeds
`org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold'.

(defvar org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold 5000
  "Document word count at which a cover page will be used automatically.
This condition is applied when cover page option is set to auto.")
(defvar org-latex-subtitle-coverpage-format "\\\\\\bigskip\n\\LARGE\\mdseries\\itshape\\color{black!80} %s\\par"
  "Variant of `org-latex-subtitle-format' to use with the cover page.")

***** COMMENT Condensed lists
LaTeX is generally pretty good by default, but it's /really/ generous with how
much space it puts between list items by default. I'm generally not a fan.

Thankfully this is easy to correct with a small snippet:
#+name: latex-condense-lists
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\let\\olditem\\itemize\\renewcommand{\\itemize}{\\olditem\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
\\let\\oldenum\\enumerate\\renewcommand{\\enumerate}{\\oldenum\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
\\let\\olddesc\\description\\renewcommand{\\description}{\\olddesc\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-2ex}}
#+end_src

Then we can just hook this in with our clever preamble.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-condense-lists t
  "Reduce the space between list items.")
(defvar org-latex-condensed-lists "

***** COMMENT Pretty code blocks

We could just use minted for syntax highlighting --- however, we can do better!
The =engrave-faces= package lets us use Emacs' font-lock for syntax highlighting,
exporting that as LaTeX commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-listings 'engraved) ; NOTE non-standard value
#+end_src

Thanks to ~org-latex-conditional-features~ and some copy-paste with the =minted=
entry in ~org-latex-scr-block~ we can easily add this as a recognised
~org-latex-listings~ value.

#+end_src

Whenever this is used, in order for it to actually work (and look a little
better) we add bit to the preamble:

#+name: org-latex-engraved-code-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fvextra}
\\fvset{
  commandchars=\\\\\\{\\},
  highlightcolor=white!95!black!80!blue,
  breaklines=true,
  breaksymbol=\\color{white!60!black}\\tiny\\ensuremath{\\hookrightarrow}}
\\renewcommand\\theFancyVerbLine{\\footnotesize\\color{black!40!white}\\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}

\\definecolor{codebackground}{HTML}{f7f7f7}
\\definecolor{codeborder}{HTML}{f0f0f0}

% TODO have code boxes keep line vertical alignment
\\usepackage[breakable,xparse]{tcolorbox}
\\DeclareTColorBox[]{Code}{o}%
{colback=codebackground, colframe=codeborder,
  fontupper=\\footnotesize,
  colupper=EFD,
  IfNoValueTF={#1}%
  {boxsep=2pt, arc=2.5pt, outer arc=2.5pt,
    boxrule=0.5pt, left=2pt}%
  {boxsep=2.5pt, arc=0pt, outer arc=0pt,
    boxrule=0pt, leftrule=1.5pt, left=0.5pt},
  right=2pt, top=1pt, bottom=0.5pt,
  breakable}
#+end_src

At some point it would be nice to make the box colours easily customisable. At
the moment it's fairly easy to change the syntax highlighting colours with
src_elisp{(setq engrave-faces-preset-styles (engrave-faces-generate-preset))},
but perhaps a toggle which specifies whether to use the default values, the
current theme, or any named theme could be a good idea. It should also possible
to set the box background dynamically to match. The named theme could work by
looking for a style definition with a certain name in a cache dir, and then
switching to that theme and producing (and saving) the style definition if it
doesn't exist.

Now let's have the example block be styled similarly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-example-block-engraved (orig-fn example-block contents info)
  "Like `org-latex-example-block', but supporting an engraved backend"
  :around #'org-latex-example-block
  (let ((output-block (funcall orig-fn example-block contents info)))
    (if (eq 'engraved (plist-get info :latex-listings))
        (format "\\begin{Code}[alt]\n%s\n\\end{Code}" output-block)
      output-block)))
#+end_src

In addition to the vastly superior visual output, this should also be much
faster to compile for code-heavy documents (like this config).

Performing a little benchmark with this document, I find that this is indeed the
case.

| LaTeX syntax highlighting backend | Compile time | Overhead | Overhead ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
| verbatim                          | 12 s         | 0        |            0.0 |
| lstlistings                       | 15 s         | 3 s      |            0.2 |
| Engrave                           | 34 s         | 22 s     |            1.8 |
| Pygments (Minted)                 | 184 s        | 172 s    |           14.3 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2-@2$2::$4=$3 / @2$2;%.1f

Treating the verbatim (no syntax highlighting) result as a baseline; this
rudimentary test suggest that =engrave-faces= is around eight times faster than
=pygments=, and takes three times as long as no syntax highlighting (verbatim).

***** COMMENT Julia code blocks
Julia code has fantastic support for unicode! The downside is that =pdflatex= is
/still/ a pain to use with unicode symbols. The solution --- =lualatex=. Now we just
need to make it automatic

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-pick-compiler (_contents info)
  :before #'org-latex-template
  (when (and org-export-has-code-p (memq 'julia-code (org-latex-detect-features)))
    (setf info (plist-put
                (if (member #'+org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars (plist-get info :filter-final-output))
                    (plist-put info :filter-final-output
                               (delq #'+org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars (plist-get info :filter-final-output)))
                  info)
                :latex-compiler "lualatex"))))
#+end_src

Then a font with unicode support must be used. JuliaMono is the obvious choice,
and we can use it with the =fontspec= package. In future it may be nice to set
this just as a fallback font (when it isn't a pain to do so).

#+name: julia-mono-fontspec
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fontspec}
\\newfontfamily\\JuliaMono{JuliaMono-Regular.ttf}[Path=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/, Extension=.ttf]
\\newfontface\\JuliaMonoRegular{JuliaMono-Regular}
\\setmonofont{JuliaMonoRegular}[Contextuals=Alternate, Scale=MatchLowercase]
#+end_src

Now all that remains is to hook this into the preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(setq org-latex-julia-mono-fontspec "
<<julia-mono-fontspec>>
")

(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(julia-code :snippet org-latex-julia-mono-fontspec :order 0) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((and org-export-has-code-p "^[ \t]*#\\+begin_src julia\\|^[ \t]*#\\+BEGIN_SRC julia\\|src_julia") . julia-code) t)

(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.microtype-lualatex :eager t :when (microtype julia-code) :prevents microtype :order 0.1 :snippet "\\usepackage[activate={true,nocompatibility},final,tracking=true,factor=2000]{microtype}\n"))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.custom-font-no-mono :eager t :prevents custom-font :order 0 :snippet (org-latex-fontset :serif :sans)) t)
#+end_src

***** COMMENT Emojis
It would be nice to actually include emojis where used.
Thanks to =emojify=, we have a folder of emoji images just sitting and waiting to
be used 🙂.

First up, we want to detect when emojis are actually present. We can try
checking the unicode ranges with a collection of =[?-?]= regex groups, but Emojis
are actually spread around a fair bit and so this isn't very straightforward.
Instead I can iterate thorough non-ASCII characters and check if any have the
text property =emojified=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify-emoji-in-buffer-p ()
  "Determine if any emojis are present in the current buffer, using `emojify-mode'."
  (unless emojify-mode
    (emojify-mode 1)
    (emojify-display-emojis-in-region (point-min) (point-max)))
  (let (emoji-found end)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (not (or emoji-found end))
        (if-let ((pos (re-search-forward "[^[:ascii:]]" nil t)))
            (when (get-text-property (1- pos) 'emojified)
              (setq emoji-found t))
          (setq end t))))
    emoji-found))
#+end_src

Once we know that there are emojis present we can add a bit of preamble to the
buffer to make insertion easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-emoji-setup ()
  (format "\\newcommand\\emoji[1]{\\raisebox{-0.3ex}{\\includegraphics[height=1.8ex]{%s/#1}}}" (emojify-image-dir)))

(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((emojify-emoji-in-buffer-p) . emoji) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(emoji :requires image :snippet (org-latex-emoji-setup) :order 3 ))
#+end_src

Once again making use of =emojify=, we can generate LaTeX commands for our emojis
fairly easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify-latexify-emoji-in-buffer ()
  (unless emojify-mode
    (emojify-mode 1)
    (emojify-display-emojis-in-region (point-min) (point-max)))
  (let (end)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (not end)
        (if-let ((pos (re-search-forward "[^[:ascii:]]\\{1,2\\}" nil t)))
            (when-let ((char (get-text-property (1- pos) 'emojify-text))
                       (emoji (emojify-get-emoji char)))
              (replace-match (format "\\\\emoji{%s}" (file-name-sans-extension (ht-get emoji "image")))))
          (setq end t))))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to hook this handy function into Org's export.
We can't use standard string-replacement as we rely on the buffer modifications
enacted by src_elisp{(emojify-mode)}.

As I have not yet implemented a nice way of sharing feature detection
information outside of src_elisp{(org-latex-generate-features-preamble)}, we'll
use the same check before attempting to LaTeXify emojis and hope that nothing
strange happens.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-latex-convert-emojis (text backend _info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)

This works fairly nicely, there's just one little QOL upgrade that we can
perform. =emojify= downloads the ~72x72~ versions of Twemoji, however SVG versions
are also produced. We could use ~inkscape~ to convert those to PDFs, which would
likely be best for including.

First, it's worth checking whether =.pdf= graphics files will be prioritised over
=.png= files. If so, that would be ideal as no extra effort is required past
fetching and converting the files.

#+begin_src shell :tangle no :exports both :results output verbatim :wrap example

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
\Gin@extensions:
macro:->.pdf,.png,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,.PDF,.PNG,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2,.eps
#+end_example

Fantastic! We can see that =.pdf= actually comes first in the priority list. So
now we just need to fetch and convert those SVGs --- ideally with a handy
command to do so for us.

***** COMMENT Remove non-ascii chars

When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

We check every non-ascii character to make sure it's not a character encoded by
the =inputenc= packages when loaded with the =utf8= option. Finally, we see if we
have our own LaTeX conversion we can apply and if there is none we replace the
non-ascii char with =¿=.

No to make sure we only remove characters that can't be displayed, we check
=/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/utf8enc.dfu=.

We just need to make sure this is appended to the list of filter functions,
since we want to let emoji processing occur first.

***** Extra special strings
LaTeX already recognises =---= and =--= as em/en-dashes, =\-= as a shy hyphen, and the
conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike
~org-html-plain-text~).

I'd quite like to also recognise =->= and =<-=, so let's set come up with some advice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

***** COMMENT Support images from URLs
You can link to remote images easily, and they work nicely with HTML-based
exports. However, LaTeX can only include local files, and so the current
behaviour of =org-latex-link= is just to insert a URL to the image.

We can do better than that by downloading the image to a predictable location,
and using that. By making the filename predictable as opposed to just another
tempfile, this can provide a caching mechanism.

**** COMMENT ASCII export
To start with, why settle for ASCII when UTF-8 exists?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ascii-charset 'utf-8)
#+end_src

The ASCII export is generally fairly nice. I think the main aspect that could
benefit from improvement is the appearance of LaTeX fragments. There's a nice
utility we can use to create unicode representation, which are much nicer.
It's called ~latex2text~, and it's part of the =pylatexenc= package, and it's [[https://repology.org/project/python:pylatexenc/versions][not
really packaged]]. So, we'll resort to installing it with =pip=.

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pylatexenc
#+end_src

With that installed, we can override the src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-fragment)} and
src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-environment)} functions, which are conveniently very
slim --- just extracting the content, and indenting. We'll only do something
different when =utf-8= is set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "yes" "no")
(after! ox-ascii
  (defvar org-ascii-convert-latex t
    "Use latex2text to convert LaTeX elements to unicode.")

          (if (= (car unicode) 0) ; utf-8 set, and sucessfully ran latex2text

#+end_src

**** COMMENT Markdown Export
When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere (for example when using [[Emacs Everywhere][Emacs
Everywhere]]), it can be preferable to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead
of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…")
           ("->" . "→")
           ("<-" . "←"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (let ((frag (org-element-property :value latex-fragment)))
      (cond
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\(" frag)
        (concat "$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$"))
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\\\[" frag)
        (concat "$$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$$"))
       (t (message "unrecognised fragment: %s" frag)
          frag))))

  (defun org-md-latex-environment (latex-environment contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT object from Org to Markdown."

    "Transcode an ENTITY object from Org to utf-8.

    (org-element-property :utf-8 entity))

  ;; We can't let this be immediately parsed and evaluated,
  ;; because eager macro-expansion tries to call as-of-yet
  ;; undefined functions.
  ;; NOTE in the near future this shouldn't be required
  (eval

*** Babel
Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-transient-hook! #'org-babel-execute-src-block
  (require 'ob-async))

(defvar org-babel-auto-async-languages '()
  "Babel languages which should be executed asyncronously by default.")

  "Eagarly add an :async parameter to the src information, unless it seems problematic.
This only acts o languages in `org-babel-auto-async-languages'.

    (when (and (string= "none" (cdr (assoc :session (caddr result))))
               (member (car result) org-babel-auto-async-languages)
               (not (assoc :async (caddr result))) ; don't duplicate

Now we just need to make a mode to use this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-derived-mode pdf-text-mode so-long-mode "PDF Text" ; so-long for the initial buffer load time
  "Major mode for viewing the plaintext version of a PDF."
  (set-buffer-multibyte t)
  (read-only-mode t)
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook (lambda () (user-error "Will not overwrite PDF with plaintext version")))
  (dolist (hook '(window-configuration-change-hook
                  window-size-change-functions
                  display-line-numbers-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook 'pdf-text--update))
  (pdf-text--update)
  (text-mode)
  (setq mode-name "PDF Text"))
#+end_src

In src_elisp{(pdf-text--update)} there's mention of position saving and
restoring. This needs to be implemented, and it's a bit difficult since the line
numbers and buffer positions are liable to change. So, instead we can try to
take note of some markers (such as the line breaks) and try to make our way to
them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun pdf-text--position-info ()
  (list :page-no (let ((current-point (point))
                       (page-no 0))
                   (save-excursion
                     (while (search-forward "\f" current-point t)
                       (setq page-no (1+ page-no))))
                   page-no)
        :par-start (save-excursion
                     (forward-paragraph -1)
                     (forward-line 1)
                     (thing-at-point 'line t))
        :previous-line-content (save-excursion
                                 (forward-line -1)
                                 (thing-at-point 'line t))))

(defun pdf-text--goto-pos (pos)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (search-forward "\f" nil nil (plist-get pos :page-no))
  (re-search-forward (replace-regexp-in-string " +" "[ \n]+" (regexp-quote (plist-get pos :par-start))))
  (unless (string= (plist-get pos :par-start)
                   (plist-get pos :previous-line-content))
    (re-search-forward (replace-regexp-in-string " +" "[ \n]+" (regexp-quote (plist-get pos :previous-line-content)))
                       (save-excursion (forward-paragraph 1) (point)))))
#+end_src

Unfortunately while in isolated testing this position restoring works well, for
some reason as it's currently used it doesn't seem to work at all.

The output can be slightly nicer without spelling errors, and with prettier page
feeds (=^L= by default).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'pdf-text-mode-hook #'spell-fu-mode-disable)
(add-hook 'pdf-text-mode-hook (lambda () (page-break-lines-mode 1)))
#+end_src

This is very nice, now we just need to associate it with =.pdf= files, and make
sure =pdf-tools= doesn't take priority.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst pdf-text-auto-mode-alist-entry
  '("\\.[pP][dD][fF]\\'" . pdf-text-mode)
  "The entry to use for `auto-mode-alist'.")

(defun pdf-text-install ()
  "Add a \".pdf\" associaton for all future buffers."
  (interactive)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist pdf-text-auto-mode-alist-entry)
  (when (featurep 'pdf-tools)
    (setq-default auto-mode-alist
                  (remove pdf-tools-auto-mode-alist-entry auto-mode-alist))
    (setq-default magic-mode-alist

Lastly, whenever Emacs is non-graphical (i.e. a TUI), we want to use this by default.

** Markdown
Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which

#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
