* Binary files :binary:hexl:
The binary file check is inspired by [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10277/make-emacs-automatically-open-binary-files-in-hexl-mode][this discussion]]. I want to configure Emacs
to open binary files in =hexl-mode=. Some binary files are special, notably
executable files, lets define a major mode (=objdump-disassemble-mode=) to display
them as assembly code using =objdump=. The file types are detected using the =file=
utility.
